    origin_gas_giant_desc: "During this empire's early space age their homeworld was struck by a stray comet. Already possessed enough infrastructure in space to survive temporarily, a gas giant mining station became their new home. Over the years the gas giant has fulfilled their needs many times over, bringing new insights into the various gases that occur in the galaxy. Due to an abundance of exotic gases during this empire's development, improved industrial techniques using these gases have been refined, albeit with a reliance on these gases for even the most basic industry."
